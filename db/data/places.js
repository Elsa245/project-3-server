And between the cobblestone alleys and richly painted walls, you’ll wonder if you’ve somehow stepped back in time. Having lunch in the business district is one of my favorite non touristy things to do in London. I love the bustling energy and the efficient service. It’s a completely different feel from the hectic, haphazard lunch spots near the major tourist attractions.',

Note that there are multiple ponds: one is mixed, one is ladies only, and one is for men. There’s not much in the way of facilities or lockers, so it’s best if you can have a lookout for your stuff. Admission is quite affordable at 2 pounds (as of 2019), making it one of the best cheap things to do in London in summer.',

Taking a walk/run/bike/horseback ride through the winding trails is one of the best fun active things to do in London. I recommend an early morning visit, as that’s when the deer are most active. For photographers, I can’t think of a more magical photo opportunity than a deer at golden hour surrounded by trees and fog.',
